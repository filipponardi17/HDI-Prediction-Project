# **HDI Prediction Project**

This project focuses on predicting Human Development Index (HDI) based on questionnaire data of life attitudes . The goal is to analyze the factors influencing HDI and build models for both continuous and categorical target variables.

## **Overview**

The project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset using various machine learning techniques. It aims to understand the relationships between questionnaire responses and HDI, providing insights into the socioeconomic indicators influencing human development.

## **Background**

This was the second homework for a Statistical Learning course at UC3M.
The motivation behind this project is to uncover the complex relationships between questionnaire responses and HDI. By predicting HDI, the project seeks to identify key socioeconomic indicators that significantly impact human development.

## **Data**

The dataset used in this project includes questionnaire responses and corresponding HDI values. The dataset's source, key features, and any preprocessing steps performed are detailed. You can access the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## **Methods**

Various machine learning techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost are employed. The project involves both regression and classification tasks to predict continuous and categorical HDI values, respectively.

## **Results**

The results showcase the predictive performance of different models. For continuous HDI, models such as linear regression, KNN, and Random Forest are evaluated based on metrics like RMSE and R-squared. For categorical HDI, logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are utilized, emphasizing accuracy and AUC.

## **Limitations**

Challenges encountered during the project, such as computational constraints and model performance, are discussed. The limitations provide context for interpreting the results.
